1. Dyslexia-Aware Reading Feedback (Extreme Detail)
This feature provides a comprehensive early screening system for dyslexia and related reading disabilities by analyzing both audio and text inputs of student reading performance.

Functionality:

The system accepts either recorded audio samples of students reading aloud or typed text samples of their reading exercises.

For audio inputs, it performs speech recognition to transcribe spoken words, capturing phonetic accuracy, mispronunciations, omitted words, and hesitations.

Advanced machine learning models trained on neurodevelopmental disorder datasets analyze speech patterns such as pace, rhythm, error types, and prosody deviations indicative of dyslexia.

For text inputs, handwriting analysis using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) detects irregular letter shapes, inconsistent spacing, and writing slant anomalies correlated with motor impairments seen in dyslexic learners.

Integrates eye-tracking and cognitive task performance data if available, to enhance classification accuracy.

Utilizes a multi-stage AI pipeline combining CNNs for visual pattern recognition, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for temporal audio sequence modeling, and decision-level fusion for final risk estimation.

The output is a real-time, interpretable risk score displayed to teachers alongside actionable insights, highlighting specific errors and suggested interventions.

Provides graphical visualizations of reading fluency, accuracy, and attention metrics.

Enables longitudinal tracking of student progress to monitor improvements or emerging difficulties.

Alerts teachers immediately when thresholds are crossed, allowing early intervention.

Technical Implementation Notes:

Modular API endpoints receive audio/text, preprocess and normalize inputs, run inference on AI models, and return detailed structured feedback.

Processes are optimized for speed to allow near real-time classroom use.

Includes confidence scoring and fallback heuristics for low-quality input.

Designed to support multiple Indian languages, dialects, and regional scripts.

Complies with privacy best practices, encrypting all sensitive data end-to-end.
